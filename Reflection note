**Reflection note**

I initially built a schema around correspondance (opener, dateline, closer) by generating the ODD from the Kafka letter. 
Extending this to Antigone's text was the most time-consuming.
One of the biggest technical obstacles was trying to integrate drama elements. 
I attempted to incorporate <sp>, <speaker>, and <stage> elements for theatrical markup, 
but I ended up with 50 validation errors.
After multiple failed attempts adjusting content models and consulting documentation, I made a pragmatic decision.
I adopted a unified analytical approach using <seg>/@ana across all three samples.
Another obstacle was documenting the Schematron constraint. Using <exemplum> proved impossible for me, despite multiple attempts, it triggered validation errors in the ODD itself,  as "exemplum not allowed here".
I suspect a problem with the namespaces, but I wasn't able to fix this.
Key strategies that helped me succeed included systematic validation (testing after each small change rather than encoding all texts first) 
and consulting the TEI Guidelines not just for syntax but for understanding. 
What helped me was to go slow and focus on each document one after the other.
I ended up at the start with a lot of duplicates of the same elements, 
which I had to be careful about and note in a separate document to keep track of. XPath was also useful to keep track of elements.

This project challenged me to adapt theory to practical decisions across diverse text types. In Assignment 1, I used TEI as a crutch,
which stopped me from really thinking about making the project "personal" to my goals. 
As of this assignment, the most important part of the learning process has been to understand the structures 
of XML and how they interact with each other. But being able to write the rules made it easy to control certain things that are central to the project.
Before, with TEI ALL, you could put anything into "ana," but here I can control specific values so it signals when an error is made. 
These challenges forced me to think carefully into each encoding decisions.
