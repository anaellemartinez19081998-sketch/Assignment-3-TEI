# Assignment-3-TEI
This repository contains the final project for the M2 TNAH XML-TEI course. The project focuses on creating a customized TEI schema (ODD) to analyze a corpus of three distinct literary genres: personal correspondence (Franz Kafka’s Letters to Milena), dramatic dialogue (Jean Anouilh’s Antigone), and philosophical essays (René Barjavel’s La Faim du Tigre).

AI Usage Statement
AI tools (Gemini/ChatGPT) were used to try to help troubleshoot specific XML validation errors, specifically why <exemplum> for Rule 3 did not work.None of their solutions worked and none were implimented. All the manual encoding of the text samples were done by me.
